.. py:class:: hmc

   Implements the (basic) user interface for the HMC kernel.

   The general hmc kernel (:meth:`blackjax.mcmc.hmc.kernel`, alias `blackjax.hmc.kernel`) can be
   cumbersome to manipulate. Since most users only need to specify the kernel
   parameters at initialization time, we provide a helper function that
   specializes the general kernel.

   We also add the general kernel and state generator as an attribute to this class so
   users only need to pass `blackjax.hmc` to SMC, adaptation, etc. algorithms.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   A new HMC kernel can be initialized and used with the following code:

   .. code::

       hmc = blackjax.hmc(logdensity_fn, step_size, inverse_mass_matrix, num_integration_steps)
       state = hmc.init(position)
       new_state, info = hmc.step(rng_key, state)

   Kernels are not jit-compiled by default so you will need to do it manually:

   .. code::

      step = jax.jit(hmc.step)
      new_state, info = step(rng_key, state)

   Should you need to you can always use the base kernel directly:

   .. code::

      import blackjax.mcmc.integrators as integrators

      kernel = blackjax.hmc.kernel(integrators.mclachlan)
      state = blackjax.hmc.init(position, logdensity_fn)
      state, info = kernel(rng_key, state, logdensity_fn, step_size, inverse_mass_matrix, num_integration_steps)

                                 sample step before returning a sample.
   :param divergence_threshold: The absolute value of the difference in energy between two states above
                                which we say that the transition is divergent. The default value is
                                commonly found in other libraries, and yet is arbitrary.
   :param integrator: (algorithm parameter) The symplectic integrator to use to integrate the trajectory.

   Implements the (basic) user interface for the MALA kernel.

   The general mala kernel (:meth:`blackjax.mcmc.mala.kernel`, alias `blackjax.mala.kernel`) can be
   cumbersome to manipulate. Since most users only need to specify the kernel
   parameters at initialization time, we provide a helper function that
   specializes the general kernel.

   We also add the general kernel and state generator as an attribute to this class so
   users only need to pass `blackjax.mala` to SMC, adaptation, etc. algorithms.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   A new MALA kernel can be initialized and used with the following code:

   .. code::

       mala = blackjax.mala(logdensity_fn, step_size)
       state = mala.init(position)
       new_state, info = mala.step(rng_key, state)

   Kernels are not jit-compiled by default so you will need to do it manually:

   .. code::

      step = jax.jit(mala.step)
      new_state, info = step(rng_key, state)

   Should you need to you can always use the base kernel directly:

   .. code::

      kernel = blackjax.mala.kernel(logdensity_fn)
      state = blackjax.mala.init(position, logdensity_fn)
      state, info = kernel(rng_key, state, logdensity_fn, step_size)

       state = nuts.init(position)
       new_state, info = nuts.step(rng_key, state)

   We can JIT-compile the step function for more speed:

   .. code::

       step = jax.jit(nuts.step)
       new_state, info = step(rng_key, state)

   You can always use the base kernel should you need to:

      import blackjax.mcmc.integrators as integrators

      kernel = blackjax.nuts.kernel(integrators.yoshida)
      state = blackjax.nuts.init(position, logdensity_fn)

.. py:class:: mgrad_gaussian

   Implements the marginal sampler for latent Gaussian model of :cite:p:`titsias2018auxiliary`.

   It uses a first order approximation to the log_likelihood of a model with Gaussian prior.
   Interestingly, the only parameter that needs calibrating is the "step size" delta, which can be done very efficiently.
   Calibrating it to have an acceptance rate of roughly 50% is a good starting point.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   A new marginal latent Gaussian MCMC kernel for a model q(x) ‚àù exp(f(x)) N(x; m, C) can be initialized and
   used for a given "step size" delta with the following code:

   .. code::

       mgrad_gaussian = blackjax.mgrad_gaussian(f, C, use_inverse=False, mean=m)
       state = mgrad_gaussian.init(zeros)  # Starting at the mean of the prior
       new_state, info = mgrad_gaussian.step(rng_key, state, delta)

   We can JIT-compile the step function for better performance

   .. code::

       step = jax.jit(mgrad_gaussian.step)
       new_state, info = step(rng_key, state, delta)

   :param logdensity_fn: The logarithm of the likelihood function for the latent Gaussian model.

   :type mean: optional

   :rtype: A ``MCMCSamplingAlgorithm``.


.. py:class:: sgld

   Implements the (basic) user interface for the SGLD kernel.

   The general sgld kernel (:meth:`blackjax.mcmc.sgld.kernel`, alias
   `blackjax.sgld.kernel`) can be cumbersome to manipulate. Since most users
   only need to specify the kernel parameters at initialization time, we
   provide a helper function that specializes the general kernel.

   .. rubric:: Example

   To initialize a SGLD kernel one needs to specify a schedule function, which
   returns a step size at each sampling step, and a gradient estimator
   function. Here for a constant step size, and `data_size` data samples:

   .. code::

       grad_fn = blackjax.sgmcmc.gradients.grad_estimator(logprior_fn, loglikelihood_fn, data_size)

   We can now initialize the sgld kernel and the state:

   .. code::

       sgld = blackjax.sgld(grad_fn)
       state = sgld.init(position)

   Assuming we have an iterator `batches` that yields batches of data we can
   perform one step:

   .. code::

       step_size = 1e-3
       minibatch = next(batches)
       new_state = sgld.step(rng_key, state, minibatch, step_size)

   Kernels are not jit-compiled by default so you will need to do it manually:

   .. code::

      step = jax.jit(sgld.step)
      new_state, info = step(rng_key, state, minibatch, step_size)

   :param grad_estimator: A function that takes a position, a batch of data and returns an estimation
                          of the gradient of the log-density at this position.

   :rtype: A ``MCMCSamplingAlgorithm``.

   .. py:attribute:: kernel

      


.. py:class:: sghmc

   Implements the (basic) user interface for the SGHMC kernel.

   The general sghmc kernel (:meth:`blackjax.mcmc.sghmc.kernel`, alias
   `blackjax.sghmc.kernel`) can be cumbersome to manipulate. Since most users
   only need to specify the kernel parameters at initialization time, we
   provide a helper function that specializes the general kernel.

   .. rubric:: Example

   To initialize a SGHMC kernel one needs to specify a schedule function, which
   returns a step size at each sampling step, and a gradient estimator
   function. Here for a constant step size, and `data_size` data samples:

   .. code::

       grad_estimator = blackjax.sgmcmc.gradients.grad_estimator(logprior_fn, loglikelihood_fn, data_size)

   We can now initialize the sghmc kernel and the state. Like HMC, SGHMC needs the user to specify a number of integration steps.

   .. code::

       sghmc = blackjax.sghmc(grad_estimator, num_integration_steps)
       state = sghmc.init(position)

   Assuming we have an iterator `batches` that yields batches of data we can
   perform one step:

   .. code::

       step_size = 1e-3
       minibatch = next(batches)
       new_state = sghmc.step(rng_key, state, minibatch, step_size)

   Kernels are not jit-compiled by default so you will need to do it manually:

   .. code::

      step = jax.jit(sghmc.step)
      new_state, info = step(rng_key, state, minibatch, step_size)

   :param grad_estimator: A function that takes a position, a batch of data and returns an estimation
                          of the gradient of the log-density at this position.

   :rtype: A ``MCMCSamplingAlgorithm``.

   .. py:attribute:: kernel

      


.. py:class:: csgld

   Implements the (basic) user interface for the Contour SGLD kernel.

   :param logdensity_estimator_fn: A function that returns an estimation of the model's logdensity given
                                   a position and a batch of data.
   :param zeta: Hyperparameter that controls the geometric property of the flattened
                density. If `zeta=0` the function reduces to the SGLD step function.
   :param temperature: Temperature parameter.
   :param num_partitions: The number of partitions we divide the energy landscape into.
   :param energy_gap: The difference in energy :math:`\Delta u` between the successive
                      partitions. Can be determined by running e.g. an optimizer to determine
                      the range of energies. `num_partition` * `energy_gap` should match this
                      range.
   :param min_energy: A rough estimate of the minimum energy in a dataset, which should be
                      strictly smaller than the exact minimum energy! e.g. if the minimum
                      energy of a dataset is 3456, we can set min_energy to be any value
                      smaller than 3456. Set it to 0 is acceptable, but not efficient enough.
                      the closer the gap between min_energy and 3456 is, the better.

.. py:function:: window_adaptation(algorithm: Union[hmc, nuts], logdensity_fn: Callable, is_mass_matrix_diagonal: bool = True, initial_step_size: float = 1.0, target_acceptance_rate: float = 0.8, progress_bar: bool = False, **extra_parameters) -> blackjax.base.AdaptationAlgorithm

   Adapt the value of the inverse mass matrix and step size parameters of
   algorithms in the HMC fmaily.

   Algorithms in the HMC family on a euclidean manifold depend on the value of
   at least two parameters: the step size, related to the trajectory
   integrator, and the mass matrix, linked to the euclidean metric.

   Good tuning is very important, especially for algorithms like NUTS which can
   be extremely inefficient with the wrong parameter values. This function
   provides a general-purpose algorithm to tune the values of these parameters.
   Originally based on Stan's window adaptation, the algorithm has evolved to
   improve performance and quality.

   :param algorithm: The algorithm whose parameters are being tuned.
   :param logdensity_fn: The log density probability density function from which we wish to
                         sample.
   :param is_mass_matrix_diagonal: Whether we should adapt a diagonal mass matrix.
   :param initial_step_size: The initial step size used in the algorithm.
   :param target_acceptance_rate: The acceptance rate that we target during step size adaptation.
   :param progress_bar: Whether we should display a progress bar.
   :param \*\*extra_parameters: The extra parameters to pass to the algorithm, e.g. the number of
                                integration steps for HMC.

   :rtype: A function that runs the adaptation and returns an `AdaptationResult` object.


.. py:function:: meads_adaptation(logdensity_fn: Callable, num_chains: int) -> blackjax.base.AdaptationAlgorithm

   Adapt the parameters of the Generalized HMC algorithm.

   The Generalized HMC algorithm depends on three parameters, each controlling
   one element of its behaviour: step size controls the integrator's dynamics,
   alpha controls the persistency of the momentum variable, and delta controls
   the deterministic transformation of the slice variable used to perform the
   non-reversible Metropolis-Hastings accept/reject step.

   The step size parameter is chosen to ensure the stability of the velocity
   verlet integrator, the alpha parameter to make the influence of the current
   state on future states of the momentum variable to decay exponentially, and
   the delta parameter to maximize the acceptance of proposal but with good
   mixing properties for the slice variable. These characteristics are targeted
   by controlling heuristics based on the maximum eigenvalues of the correlation
   and gradient matrices of the cross-chain samples, under simpifyng assumptions.

   Good tuning is fundamental for the non-reversible Generalized HMC sampling
   algorithm to explore the target space efficienty and output uncorrelated, or
   as uncorrelated as possible, samples from the target space. Furthermore, the
   single integrator step of the algorithm lends itself for fast sampling
   on parallel computer architectures.

   :param logdensity_fn: The log density probability density function from which we wish to sample.
   :param num_chains: Number of chains used for cross-chain warm-up training.

   :returns: * *A function that returns the last cross-chain state, a sampling kernel with the*
             * *tuned parameter values, and all the warm-up states for diagnostics.*

.. py:class:: orbital_hmc

   Implements the (basic) user interface for the Periodic orbital MCMC kernel.

   Each iteration of the periodic orbital MCMC outputs ``period`` weighted samples from
   a single Hamiltonian orbit connecting the previous sample and momentum (latent) variable
   with precision matrix ``inverse_mass_matrix``, evaluated using the ``bijection`` as an

   .. py:attribute:: kernel

      


.. py:class:: ghmc

   Implements the (basic) user interface for the Generalized HMC kernel.

   The Generalized HMC kernel performs a similar procedure to the standard HMC
   kernel with the difference of a persistent momentum variable and a non-reversible
   Metropolis-Hastings step instead of the standard Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
   step.

   This means that the sampling of the momentum variable depends on the previous
   momentum, the rate of persistence depends on the alpha parameter, and that the
   Metropolis-Hastings accept/reject step is done through slice sampling with a
   non-reversible slice variable also dependent on the previous slice, the determinisitc
   transformation is defined by the delta parameter.

   The Generalized HMC does not have a trajectory length parameter, it always performs
   one iteration of the velocity verlet integrator with a given step size, making
   the algorithm a good candiate for running many chains in parallel.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   A new Generalized HMC kernel can be initialized and used with the following code:

   .. code::

       ghmc_kernel = blackjax.ghmc(logdensity_fn, step_size, alpha, delta)
       state = ghmc_kernel.init(rng_key, position)
       new_state, info = ghmc_kernel.step(rng_key, state)

   We can JIT-compile the step function for better performance

   .. code::

   :param logdensity_fn: The log-density function we wish to draw samples from.
   :param step_size: A PyTree of the same structure as the target PyTree (position) with the
                     values used for as a step size for each dimension of the target space in
                     the velocity verlet integrator.
   :param alpha: The value defining the persistence of the momentum variable.
   :param delta: The value defining the deterministic translation of the slice variable.
   :param divergence_threshold: The absolute value of the difference in energy between two states above
                                which we say that the transition is divergent. The default value is
                                commonly found in other libraries, and yet is arbitrary.
   :param noise_gn: A function that takes as input the slice variable and outputs a random
                    variable used as a noise correction of the persistent slice update.
                    The parameter defaults to a random variable with a single atom at 0.

   Pathfinder locates normal approximations to the target density along a
   quasi-Newton optimization path, with local covariance estimated using
   the inverse Hessian estimates produced by the L-BFGS optimizer.
   Pathfinder returns draws from the approximation with the lowest estimated
   Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the true posterior.

   Note: all the heavy processing in performed in the init function, step
   function is just a drawing a sample from a normal distribution
